# Algorithms & Datastructures

This repository contains implementations of all algorithms and data structures
that are a part of the curriculum in the TDT4120 course at NTNU, please see
https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4120 for more details.

The algorithms are implemented in Scala, using a mix of functional and
imperative programming techniques to gain the benefits of using the static
and impressive type system Scala offers, while keeping the core logic in the
algorithms recognizable to developers that are not familiar with Scala from
before.

> Note that not all algorithms and data structures are implemented because
> the course is still on-going and I'm not the best at keeping up with it :)
